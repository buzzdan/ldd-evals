# Baseline go-2.10.0-681fdb0 — cheap and medium tiers

Plugin `buzzdan/ai-coding-rules` at 681fdb0 (v2.10.0), the Go suite in this repository (cases and
fixture as recorded at plugin-repo commit `97194e3`) with graders calibrated afterwards and
re-applied by `ldd-eval regrade` (no agent re-spend). Agent model pinned to
`claude-sonnet-5`, judge `claude-haiku-4-5`, run 2026-09-08 from a headless container.

    ldd-eval run --tag cheap --model claude-sonnet-5 --max-cost-usd 60 --out baselines/go-2.10.0-681fdb0/cheap <cases>
    ldd-eval run --resume … --max-cost-usd 80 …          # after the cap tripped at $65.97, for the six trigger runs
    ldd-eval regrade --tag cheap --out baselines/go-2.10.0-681fdb0/cheap <cases>

Every run's `result.json` is the regraded verdict. The traces (`trace.jsonl`, the full stream) are
archived in `traces.tar.zst`; unpack them beside the verdicts before regrading:

    cd baselines/go-2.10.0-681fdb0 && zstd -dc traces.tar.zst | tar -xf - -C .
    task go:regrade OUT=baselines/go-2.10.0-681fdb0 TIER=cheap PLUGIN=<plugin dir>

Graders that read the scaffold tree (files, postcheck, art judges) report "needs the kept
scaffold" from a clone; the transcript graders reproduce. Total agent spend **$66.13**, judge $0.10.

## Pass rates

| Case | Passed | Turns | Cost | Reads as |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| trigger-non-go | 3/3 | 1,1,1 | $0.17 | negative trigger control holds |
| trigger-go | 0/3 | 1,1,2 | $0.20 | names the skill, never invokes it or announces (see caveat) |
| case-a-retention-review | 0/2 | 27,38 | $2.93 | skeptic REFUTES `RetentionDays` at score 1 |
| case-b-endpoint-review | 0/2 | 27,32 | $2.52 | skeptic REFUTES `Endpoint` parameter object and `Scheme` enum at score 1 |
| case-c-picker-review | 0/2 | 32,31 | $3.26 | skeptic REFUTES the leaf type; no falsifying-question ids cited |
| case-d-ceremony-review | 2/2 | 27,30 | $2.12 | negative control: no extraction proposed for earned ceremony |
| case-e-nils-review | 1/2 | 37,84 | $5.68 | run 2 missed the nil-return sentinel and produced no cluster block |
| case-f-globals-review | 2/2 | 48,123 | $7.37 | init(), both global reads, test mutation, clean-island fix all reported |
| centerpiece-storify-review | 2/2 | 46,46 | $9.73 | three clusters, critic verdicts on all 50 comments, skeptic CONFIRMS `Status` at 6 |
| review-full | 0/3 | 57,149,82 | $32.14 | 94, 92, 91 of 111 graders; whole-repo recall gaps differ per run |

Suite pass rate 0.43 (10 of 23 runs), average grader score 0.82.

## Findings about the plugin (Phase 2 targets, in order)

1. **The overabstraction skeptic refutes narrow, valid extractions.** Cases A, B and C
   propose one small type each (a validated int, a three-field parameter object, a leaf
   type); the skeptic scores every one 0–1 and the report demotes them to "dedupe into a
   helper". The same skeptic confirms `Status` at score 6 in the centerpiece, where the
   duplication spans eight sites. The rubric rewards breadth of duplication and never
   credits "makes invalid state unrepresentable".
2. **Whole-repo review recall is ~85 % and the misses move.** review-full passes 91–94 of
   111 graders each run, but 23 graders flip between runs: run 1 missed Case C and the
   R6/R7 test plants, runs 2 and 3 missed Case A and the R4/R5 package plants. Each run
   also clustered a different subset (ProcessHeartbeat in 1 of 3, Catalog.Find and
   Reporter in none). Run 2 raised a false positive on the R1 control (`Tenant` already
   has a type and a parser).
3. **Headless sessions wait badly.** Six of 23 runs spawned their hunters without the
   foreground flag, then polled `ReadNotifications` (up to 82 calls), armed `Monitor`
   loops, or scheduled wakeups that later fired as stale notifications. Turns and cost
   roughly doubled with no change in findings: case-e run 2 (84 turns, $4.00), case-f
   run 2 (123 turns over 12 segments, $5.05), review-full run 2 (149 turns over 16
   segments, $14.83). `segments` in each `result.json` records it; anything above 1 is
   this pathology.
4. **Reports drop the falsifying-question ids.** The skill's report example cites
   `(R1 Q1: yes; Q2: …)` per finding; two runs did, the rest cite only `R<n>`. The
   `r<n>-q<m>` graders in cases B, C and E measure this.
5. **The trigger does not fire headless.** All three trigger-go runs answered from context
   in one turn: they named `linter-driven-development` as the right skill but never called
   the Skill tool and never printed the announcement the skill mandates. Caveat: the
   dry-run system prompt says "stop as soon as you have announced the workflow", which may
   itself have discouraged the call. Re-run with a neutral dry-run instruction before
   treating 0/3 as the trigger rate.
6. Earlier in the session (see `aborted-background-subagents/`): with no
   non-interactive note, the agent ended its turn while background subagents were still
   running. Every case now carries that note.

Bonus: the Case B review found a real unplanted bug, `dial` wraps the socket in `tls.Client`
without calling `Handshake`, so `Ping` proves TCP reachability only.

## Noise floor

Graders that flip between runs of the same case: case-c 2, case-e 5, review-full 23; every
other case is stable across its runs. For the next comparison, treat a per-case change
smaller than one flipping grader as noise, and compare review-full on its grader count
(91–94 of 111), not on pass/fail.

## Grader calibration applied after the run

All shape-only: basename file anchors (`config\.go:[0-9]+`), question ids within 500 chars
of the anchor, cluster headers matched on the word "cluster" regardless of emoji, number or
case, `Critic:` or `comment-critic`, the command's "Commit Readiness Report" banner
alongside the skill's, the comma-ok fix spelled as `(Device, bool)`, and size/nesting
numbers as R3 Q1 linter evidence. One grader was removed: `cluster-status-r3` expected R3
in the Device.Status cluster, which `violations.yaml` never defined; both runs correctly
put R3 in the ProcessHeartbeat cluster.

## Medium tier (`medium/`)

Run once each with `--keep-temp` (scaffolds kept so file, postcheck and art judges regrade),
same model pins. The subset ran first (one invocation per case, so its $40 cap applied per
case, not cumulatively), then the six remaining refactor cases in one invocation over
`*-refactor` with `--resume`, which reused Case A and made the $40 cap cumulative. Agent spend
**$22.91**, judge $0.26.

| case-f-globals-refactor | 0/1 | FAIL | 83 | $2.07 | the ratchet worked: four deployable commits, `Config` global gone, `Load` returns a value, `main` wires values down; but the second plant (`var region` + `init()` + `//nolint:gochecknoinits`) was left, and the pool tests got no `t.Parallel()` or literal constructor call |
| centerpiece-storify-refactor | 0/1 | FAIL | 47 | $1.63 | cognitive 76 → 10, cyclomatic 40 → 10 (want ≤ 8), `goto` and block comments gone, five results folded into `HeartbeatResult`, black-box suite still green; but the status transition is still inline, `changed || force`, `t[7:] == "eu"` and three `context.Background()` remain, and it wrote a new `decodeHeartbeat` instead of calling the tested `ParseHeartbeatLine` next door |

Tier pass rate 0.50 (5 of 10), average grader score 0.82. Art judges: 3 of 7 PASS.

Findings added by the medium tier:

7. **The refactor path produces the art the review path refuses.** Cases A and B, given the
   files and a plain instruction, extracted exactly the domain types the review's skeptic
   scored 1 (finding 1), each into its own file with the methods the story needs, and the
   art judge passed both with quotes for every criterion. The gap is in the review's
   skeptic, not in the refactoring skill.
8. **Refactors stop at "mechanically fixed" when the plant has more than one concept.**
   Case C reached the metrics (flags gone, complexity 2) without naming the collection;
   Case E named every absence but left a nil-able pointer and a restating comment; Case F
   walked the global up the layers in clean commits but never touched the second global in
   the same file; the centerpiece cut complexity by 7× while preserving behavior yet kept
   the transition inline and re-implemented a parser that already existed. The pattern:
   the loop satisfies the linter and the tests, then declares victory one pass before the
   code reads as a story. Comments that restate names survive every refactor.
9. **Quickfix has no stopping rule.** The lint-fixer classified correctly and reported
   `LINT STATUS: escalations pending (26)`; the parent then executed every escalation
   itself in one session, 41 edits and 9 new files, until the turn cap ended it without
   a report. The command routes escalations through the refactoring skill design-first,
   so the behavior is in spec; the cost and the lost assertions are the finding.
   lint-fixer also wrote its escalations as a table, not the `ESCALATED:` lines its
   contract specifies.
10. **Commits are inconsistent.** Case F committed every step (the ratchet demands it) and
    prepare-sms committed once; quickfix and Cases A–E and the centerpiece left the result
    uncommitted in the working tree although the workflow's SHIP phase ends in a commit.
11. **Fixture weakness: the Case D control has no callers.** `Grants`, `ReplicaCount` and
    `Name` are referenced nowhere else, so deleting them is correct and the control never
    tests "leave earned ceremony alone". Wire `Grants` into a handler before the next
    baseline; the judge already tolerates deletion of unreferenced code.
12. **Single-vote llm judges flip.** `main-reads-as-a-story` on Case F passed on the live
    run and failed on regrade with the same file. Treat a one-judge change as noise; the
    plugin-eval gate's 2-of-3 vote is the fix once it opens.

## Infrastructure notes

The container was reclaimed twice while the session idled, killing the detached run each
time (once at run 9, once at run 14). `ldd-eval run --resume` reuses finished runs, so only
the in-flight run was lost each time. The trace parser now folds a self-resuming session's
multiple result events (turns and duration summed, `last_message` spanning every segment).
